This project demonstrates various MongoDB operations on the Open Foods dataset, including data querying, filtering, insertion, updating, and deletion. The examples showcase SQL-to-MongoDB query translation, focusing on product attributes such as categories, packaging, manufacturing locations, and nutritional values. Through these exercises, the project provides hands-on experience with document-based data handling and environment variable usage for seamless query execution.
